Search function:
	Default: from start address to end address
	Search RU-87PN Addr. Mode: (start address +128) --> start address --> (start address +128 + 1) --> start address + 1 etc.
	
Configure I/O module:
	1. It can configure multiple modules on search list. 
	   For example,it can configure and test the analog data for I-7024 UI and I-7017 UI at the same time.
	   For Version less than V3, it can only configure one module at a time.
	   
	2. Commands log and export commands table	
	   This function is especially useful for Modules with modbus protocol,it will save command tabel at DCON_Utility_Pro\modbus\
	   the talbe format as below.
	  		
		********************************[DO_Registers]********************************
		00266 = GET_TEMPERATURE_DISPLAY_FORMAT
		00268 = GET_MODBUS_DATAFORMAT		
		
		********************************[AI_Registers]********************************
		30000 = READ_CH0_AI
		30001 = READ_CH1_AI
		30002 = READ_CH2_AI
		30003 = READ_CH3_AI
		30004 = READ_CH4_AI
		30005 = READ_CH5_AI
		30006 = READ_CH6_AI
		30007 = READ_CH7_AI
		
	3. Remote I/O quick configuration : (includes I-7K/M-7K/I-87K/tM series)
	   This function can show and save the configutaions for above modules in offline mode. 
	   If there are large amount of the same modules with the same configurations (Communication parameters are editable)
	   It can configure the above modules in INIT* to GND state quickly, and can save much time.
	
	4. Terminal Command line can find the command list with to look up the user manual
	   If want to test the I/O modules with DCON or Modbus commands,it should find the user manual to find the commands.
	   Terminal Command line can find the command list according to module ID and protocol, 
	   if assign correct address,it will show correct command in command line.
	   
	5. RU-87PN offline configuration :
	   This function can show the configutaions for I-87K modules in offline mode, that is we can show the configration without real module.
	   This also can generate the configration file for RU-87PN/USB-87PN/ET-87PN offline.
	   
	6. Save and Restall the backplane I-87K modules on PAC system. (WP-8000, XP-8000 series)
	   For most of I-87K modules on PAC system, they need to configure the modules previous.
	   We can use this fuction to save the configurations for I-87K module on PAC to file.
	   If one of the I-87K modules is damaged, and needs to replace a new one, use this function to restall the configrations from previous file.
	   
	7. Language:
	   Support multi-language, default English, Tranditional Chinese, German, and will increase more languages in future.
	   
	8. FAQ list
	   We will collect most freqently ask qustions in Specific Topics, it will be helpful in trouble shooting.
