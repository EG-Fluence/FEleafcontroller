Below is the backup and install step:

 

1.  Prepare a usbdisk and copy  all files under the recovery folder (recovery_5.16.12) to usbdisk
2.  Power on the espressobin ultra and press any key to enter u-boot console
3.  Insert usbdisk and run “usb reset; fatload usb 0 $loadaddr recovery.bin; source $loadaddr” to load ramdisk and boot
4.  After boot completed, mount usbdisk to /media
		# mount /dev/sda1 /media
5.  Use dd command to backup the emmc disk, it will take logn time to backup the emmc disk and your usbdisk free space need to larger than 8GB.
		# dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/media/ebinx-fluence-emmc.img; sync
		# umount /media
6.  Prepare another ESPRESSObin Ultra device and insert the recovery usbdisk
7.  Power on the device and go to the u-boot console
8.  run “usb reset; fatload usb 0 $loadaddr recovery.bin; source $loadaddr” to load ramdisk and boot
9.  After boot completed, mount usbdisk to /media
10. Run dd command to restore to eMMC disk.
		# mount /dev/sda1 /media
		# dd if=/media/ebinx-fluence-emmc.img of=/dev/mmcblk0; sync
11. After restore completed, umount the usbdisk “umount /media”


========================================================================================


If you use dd command it will take more time to write image to emmc disk,
we suggest you can zip all files on emmc disk and decompress the zip file to another device, it more quickly than using dd command.

5.  Mount emmc to /mnt
		# mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt
6.  Backup the emmc content
		# cd /mnt
		# tar -zcvf /media/ebinx-fluence-rootfs.tgz *
		# sync
		# cd
		# umount /media /mnt
7.      Prepare another ESPRESSObin Ultra device and insert the recovery usbdisk
8.      Power on the device and go to the u-boot console
9.  run “usb reset; fatload usb 0 $loadaddr recovery.bin; source $loadaddr” to load ramdisk and boot
10. After boot completed, mount usbdisk to /media

11. Run “/root/mkemmc.sh /media/ebinx-fluence-rootfs.tgz”
	this mkemmc.sh will partition and format the emmc and then install ebinx-fluence-rootfs.tgz to emmc disk
12. After install completed, umount the usbdisk “umount /media”
